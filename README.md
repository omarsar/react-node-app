## Running Locally

This is just a fun app to mess around with node, react and sockets. We will see how far I get with this new journey.

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.


```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:heroku/react-node-app.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd react-node-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Side notes: I have changed the $PORT number to 5000 in order to be able to run this app on Heroku. 
Also, you might want to change APP.js so that it looks for where your app is hosted. Change this address (https://fathomless-sea-2599.herokuapp.com) to your own address. You won't need this if you are just running the app locally. That is it! Have fun!
